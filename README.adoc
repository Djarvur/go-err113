Golang linter to check the errors handling expressions

## Details

Starting from Go 1.13 the standard `error` type behaviour was changed: one `error` could be derived from another with `fmt.Errorf()` method using `%w` format specifier.

So the errors hierarchy could be built for flexible and responsible errors processing.

But to make this possible at least two simple rules should be followed:

1. `error` values should not be compared directly but with `errors.Is()` method.
1. `error` should not be created dynamically from scratch but by the wrapping the static (package-level) error.

This linter is checking the code for these 2 rulis compliance.

## Install
